# Build an iOS App Using Firebase and App Engine Flexible Environment

The Playchat sample app stores chat messages in the Firebase Realtime Database,
which automatically synchronizes that data across devices. Playchat also writes
user-event logs to the database. For more information about how the sample app
works, see [Build an iOS App Using Firebase and the App Engine Flexible
Environment](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/mobile/mobile-firebase-app-engine-flexible-ios)
in the Google Cloud Platform documentation.

The following screenshot shows the app running on the iOS Simulator:
